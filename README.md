### Introduction

This is the Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certifcate through Coursera. I am analyzing trip data from a fictional bike-share company in Chicago called Cyclistic.

I am a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team. My manager, Lily Moreno, believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen us for their mobility needs.

Cyclistic offers 3 different passes - single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. There are two types of users. Users who purchase single-ride and full-day passes are **Customers**. Users who have annual memberships are **Subscribers**. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

### Business Task
How do Customers and Subscribers use Cyclistic bikes differently?
