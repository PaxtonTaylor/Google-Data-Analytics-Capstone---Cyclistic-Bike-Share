# Analysis and Visualizations

The original Tableau dashboard is interactive where we can filter each chart between all users, Customers, or Subscribers. My points for each include analysis using these filters.

## User Count, User Percentage, and Average Ride Length by User



- We had 2,010,065 total rides in 2014.
- A majority of our users are Subscribers at 77%.
- Customers are almost 23% of our annual users.
- Customers have a longer average ride length by 4 and a half minutes.


## Day of the Week

Total Rides
- Subscribers ride more frequently during the week, peaking on Wednesdays, likely using our service to commute to/from work and run errands.
- Customers ride more on weekends, peaking on Saturdays.
- Friday is the busiest day for all users, which is likely due to Friday being the end of the work week for Subscribers and beginning of the weekend for Customers.

Average Ride Length

- Customers have a longer average ride length of 14 minutes and their longest average rides are on Sundays with 14 minutes, 45 seconds. This is likely due to them exploring the city more leisurely.
- Subscribers have an average ride length of 10 minutes and their longest average rides are on Sundays with 10 minutes, 28 seconds. They are likely using our bikes for intentional tasks like commuting to/from work, running errands, dining, etc.

## Total Rides by Hour

- Late afternoon is the busiest time to begin rides with 5pm being the most popular start time.
- Subscribers' most popular start times are 5pm followed by 8am, which lines up with work commute hours.
- Customers' most popular start times are 4pm followed by 5pm, but there is a consistently heavy use all afternoon between noon and 5pm.

## Total Rides by Month

- Summer is the busiest season with July being our busiest month.
- Subscribers have a longer high volume usage between May and October, with July being their busiest month.
- Customers are most active during the Summer between June and August, with Augest being their busiest month.
- Weather plays an important role in both memberships. Since Summer is sunnier, warmer, and people tend to be more active compared to Winter when it's colder and the days are shorter.
